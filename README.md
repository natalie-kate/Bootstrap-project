<h1 align="center">Whiskey Drop Project Website</h1>

Here is a link to the live project. (https://natalie-kate.github.io/Whiskey-Drop/)

This was a project created by coding along with the Code Instituted Bootstrap lessons.

I changed some of the styling to put my own spin on it and added media queries to allow it to be fully responsive.
